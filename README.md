Titanic Dataset Prediction

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets used for beginner-level data analysis and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, such as their age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

The goal of the Titanic prediction project is to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on their personal and travel details. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is Survived (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).

Through this project, we explore data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification model building using algorithms like Logistic Regression,
